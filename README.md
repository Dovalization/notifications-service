# NestJs Notifications Microservice

<div style="text-align: center;">

A simple microservice to send handle notifications using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) including tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) applying DDD architecture and SOLID principles.

Also included are a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) and [docker-compose.yml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) to run the app in a container.

You may also find Insomnia's [workspace](https://insomnia.rest/) useful to test the API.
